        <p>Car Rental Reservation System modules
            If a driver decides to rent a car beforehand, they go to a car rental website or app and find a vehicle that meets their needs. Then, they book it and pay for the chosen rental period, if upfront payment is required.
            
            On the appointed day, this customer arrives at the car rental location to pick up the chosen car. An agent makes copies of their IDs, explains the terms of the lease, instructs them on any special features of the car, and finally hands them the keys. When the customer drops off the car, the agent checks its mileage and inspects for any damages.
            
            In fact, the car rental process involves many more operations under the hood. Automating them improves the speed and quality of service. Letâ€™s zoom in on how each module of the Car RRS contributes to that.</p>
